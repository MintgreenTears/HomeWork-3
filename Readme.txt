This Assignment comes from the GAME351
which uses some resources from Professor

Since it was impossible to ensure that the team members could complete the task on time, 
it seemed that the remaining two team members would be busy on the weekend, 
so Wenkang and Yida completed all the rest of the work.

How is Project work?

Task1: This is done by creating three virtual cameras, two Dolly tracks and two Dolly Carts, setting up the track, 
setting the Dolly cart path so that the virtual camera can follow the dolly and look at the dolly. 
Use Timeline to manage the control logic between individual virtual cameras.

Task2: Add three kick animations to the animation controller and set three Trigger values. 
Each time you click the space button, a random number between 0 and 2 is obtained. 
According to the random number, you can determine which kick animation to play. 
Apply kick forces through X-ray inspection to add colliders and rigid bodies to tumbleweeds, baskets, crates, and buckets.

Task 3:

Task4: Add three Audio sources to trigger different music based on the scene when the player moves to a certain location, 
add animated events to complete footsteps, and add empty objects in the scene to complete wind. 
Add a taunt script for each robber in the scene and control the randomness of the taunt through the 
WaitForSeconds and Random.Range methods in the coroutine.

Task 5:

Task6: Add BanditShoot script to realize the effect of robber shooting players, 
periodically execute shooting events through InvokeRepeating, 
Instantiate bullet preform through instantiate, trigger shooting sound when firing, 
and according to the direction of the player, To give the bullet a velocity in the initial direction. 
The bullet prefab has a script attached to it that plays a hit sound when the object as a trigger 
collides with the object tagged Player.

Task7: Make rain and ripple material ball, make raindrop and ripple texture through the particle system, 
when the rain falls on the ground, it will collide with the ground and play the ripple effect. 
By setting the number and range of particle effects, it is more consistent with real world rain.
